# Fetch_Data_Challenge

Hi Team, 

For this analysis I used Pandas and DuckDB in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Pandas for EDA and data preparation
- DuckDB for building a database and running the SQL queries

I chose DuckDB because it seamlessly integrates Python and SQL. Itâ€™s quite easy to construct SQL tables from the Python dataframes I built off of the JSON files provided.

I've included a folder titled CSV-Files that contain the data I use to build the SQL database and a requirements.txt file that has all the Python packages. If you would like to follow along, install these packages in your Python enviroment and use these csv files.

Thank you!
Wynne
