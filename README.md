# Fetch_Data_Challenge

Hi Team, 

For this analysis I used Pandas and DuckDB in a Jupyter Notebook.
-Pandas for EDA and data preparation
-DuckDB for building a database and running the SQL queries. 

Im chose DuckDB because it seamlessly integrates Python and SQL. Itâ€™s quite easy to construct SQL tables from the Python dataframes I built off of the JSON files provided.

Ive included a folder titled CSV-Files that contain the data i use to build the SQL database and a requirements.txt file that has all the packages I used. If you would like to follow along, install these packages in your Python enviroment and use these csv files.

Thank you!
Wynne
